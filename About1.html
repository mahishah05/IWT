<h2> SUSTAINIBILITY COMMITMENT </h2>
At IndiGo, we strive to deliver our customer promise in the most sustainable way possible. With our investments in the new generation aircraft, we have been able to reduce CO2 footprint by around 19% in financial year 2024 as compared to 7 years ago. Today, around 78% of our fleet is new generation and due to that, we are one of the lowest CO2 emitting airlines in the world. Apart from this, sustainability is integrated at the operational level and we are making a series of investments towards more responsible flying including single engine taxiing, introduction of electric ground vehicles, electronic flight bags and water conservation techniques on-board.
